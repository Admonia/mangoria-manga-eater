    {title: 'Itachi VS Goku', body: 'Does anyone else think that although Goku is arguably the strongest anime character in existence, he would lose to Itachi Uchiha? Just looking into his eyes, which warriors do to show respect, will trap him in a mangekyou! On top of that Goku is going to offer him a sensu bean and its all over.'},
    {title: 'Dante VS Ichigo', body: 'Dante can NOT die but Ichigo is literally made of everything in the bleach universe. Plus he is the ultimate soul reaper though Im not sure how that would match up against a demon instead of hollows/Quinceys. Lets hope his bankai is faster than time stop because we know stabbing Dante in the chest does literally nothiing.'},
    {title: 'Shou Tucker Roast', body: 'This may not be a vs post like so many of you lovely nerds are posting but lets take a moment to verbally destroy the worst man in anime history. Not only did he kill his wife by turning her into a chimera he then proceeded to commit the worst crime in alchemist history. Turning his beloved daughter and dog into a talking chimera who will never feel peace. This man deserved everything Edward did and more! In fact all the anime badies should have their shot at his ugly mug.'},
    {title: 'Yuno VS Shuka', body: 'Future diary and Darwins game are similar in the fact both sets of characters plays a game using cell phones in which their lives are at stake. Yuno is extremely capable as a killer yet so is Shuka. Yuno is unpredictable while Shuka is more strategy based yet both are obsessed with their men and show signs of big crazy! Would be interesting to see Shukas sigil against Yunos total psycho mode.'},
    {title: 'Hiei appreciation', body: 'I superfan girl for this short, spikey-haired, bad tempered demon! Hes got it all, between the verbal torture of Kuwabara and his undying loyalty to Urameshi, he is one of the greatest allies in anime history (according to me). His ultimate attack, dragon of the darkness flame, leaves his enemies as charred outlines and delights me in every way.'},
    {title: 'Samurai Jack VS Rurouni Kenshin', body: 'Jack jump good but Kenshin posseses God-like speed, so between these two favored samurai, the potential for either to be the victor is endless. Both Jack and Kenshin are good men but in my opinion Kenshin got the happier (if thats what you want to call it) ending as they did Jack so dirty taking his woman from him. Maybe he could use that pain to beat Kenshin lol'},
